#Description
'github_repos_list' is a BASH script that retrieves the list of Git repositories present at a give github.com account.

'github_backup' is a BASH script that performs a check-out of all the Git repositories present at a give github.com account.

It etrives the list of all the repositories present on the github.com account and then is able to perform the backup of all the new repositories created since the last backup, with no need to update the script when repositories are added or removed.

The checked-out directories are then compressed in tar.gz archives and stored in a designated backup folder.

Only one copy of the archive is kept for each repository because the nature of the git repository, already provides means to retrived older versions of the files managed on the git repository (via the use of standard git commands).

#Installation
Place the scripts in a common path i.e. "/usr/bin" or any bin path available to the user that will execute them.

#Requirements
'github_backup' requires a .github_info file to be placed in path reachable by the user that will execute the script i.e. the homefolder, and its path need to defined in the github_backup script (~/.github_info by default)

'.github_info' must contain the following information:
- USERNAME="<username>"
- PASSWORD="<Personal access tokens>"
- ORGANIZATION="<organisation>"
- OVERWRITE="true|false" #if a backup already exists do or not overwrite it, default true (overwrite it)

Protect the GitHub login information:
- storing the file in the home folder of the user(s) that will execute the script
- defining the ownership of '.github_info' to <user>:<user>
- defining the permissions of '.github_info' to 600

#Usage
The best use of the script is to execute it periodically via a 'cron' script

'github_backup' requires one command-line parameter that defines the path where to store the backup
i.e. "/path/to/the/github/backup/folder/"

#Example
github_backup "/path/to/the/github/backup/folder/"
